## Code Snippets for Testing

This folder contains implementations of different algorithms which were generated by Codex's LLMs. The codes in this partition have been subjected to semantics preserving transformations like variable, function and method name renaming, as well as dead code insertion and function definition reordering. This dataset is used for testing the performance of LLMs on code which is generated by them itself, which falls under in-distribution samples for the LLMs.
